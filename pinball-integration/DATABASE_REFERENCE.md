## Important Indexes

```sql
-- For leaderboard lookups
idx_leaderboard_cache_rank ON Leaderboard_Cache(current_rank)

-- For recent activity
idx_high_scores_date_approved ON High_Scores_Archive(date_set DESC)

-- For game champions
idx_high_scores_player_machine ON High_Scores_Archive(player_id, machine_id)

-- For score lookups (from init scripts)
idx_scores_lookup ON High_Scores_Archive(event_code, machine_id, player_id)
idx_scores_date_set ON High_Scores_Archive(date_set)
```

## Critical Functions

### update_combined_leaderboard()
**Purpose:** Calculates combined scores and rankings
**Located:** database/functions/*.sql
**Triggered by:** n8n workflow after data ingestion

## Common Queries

### Get a player's stats
```sql
SELECT 
    p.display_name,
    lc.combined_score,
    lc.current_rank,
    COUNT(hsa.score_id) as total_games
FROM Players p
JOIN Leaderboard_Cache lc ON p.player_id = lc.player_id
LEFT JOIN High_Scores_Archive hsa ON p.player_id = hsa.player_id
WHERE p.player_id = 'PLAYER_ID_HERE'
GROUP BY p.display_name, lc.combined_score, lc.current_rank;
```

### Get machine leaderboard
```sql
SELECT 
    p.display_name,
    MAX(hsa.high_score) as best_score,
    COUNT(*) as times_played
FROM High_Scores_Archive hsa
JOIN Players p ON hsa.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE hsa.machine_id = 'BAT'  -- Batman
  AND hsa.is_approved = TRUE
GROUP BY p.display_name
ORDER BY best_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Get player's recent games
```sql
SELECT 
    m.machine_name,
    hsa.high_score,
    hsa.date_set
FROM High_Scores_Archive hsa
JOIN Machines m ON hsa.machine_id = m.machine_id
WHERE hsa.player_id = 'PLAYER_ID_HERE'
  AND hsa.is_approved = TRUE
ORDER BY hsa.date_set DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost          # PostgreSQL server
DB_PORT=5432              # PostgreSQL port
DB_NAME=pinball_analytics # Database name
DB_USER=pinball           # Database user
DB_PASSWORD=***           # Database password
```

## Maintenance Queries

### Check data freshness
```sql
SELECT 
    'High Scores' as table_name,
    MAX(date_set) as last_entry,
    COUNT(*) as total_records
FROM High_Scores_Archive
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'API Snapshots',
    MAX(fetched_at),
    COUNT(*)
FROM Api_Snapshots;
```

### Find duplicate scores (shouldn't exist)
```sql
SELECT 
    player_id,
    machine_id,
    high_score,
    event_code,
    COUNT(*) as duplicates
FROM High_Scores_Archive
GROUP BY player_id, machine_id, high_score, event_code
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Check leaderboard consistency
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_players,
    MIN(current_rank) as lowest_rank,
    MAX(current_rank) as highest_rank
FROM Leaderboard_Cache;
-- Should have consecutive ranks 1, 2, 3...
```

## Technical Stack

### Why These Choices?
✅ **Flask (Python)** - Simple, maintainable backend
✅ **Vanilla JavaScript** - No complex frameworks to learn
✅ **CSS3 Animations** - Smooth, native performance
✅ **Docker** - One-command deployment
✅ **PostgreSQL Ready** - Easy to connect your existing DB
✅ **Port 5050** - Verified available on your server

### Your Infrastructure
- Lives on: **jd-docker-01** (your Docker server)
- Accessible via: **pinball.thedelay.org** (Cloudflare tunnel)
- Easy to maintain, update, and customize

## Current State

### ✅ Ready Now (Sample Data)
- All 5 scenes working perfectly
- Beautiful animations and styling
- Kiosk controls fully functional
- Customizable branding (logo, colors)
- Production-ready Docker container
- Ready to deploy and show the bar owner!

### 🔜 Next Phase (Database Connection)
The app currently uses realistic sample data. When you're ready:
1. Follow DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md
2. Create PostgreSQL views (provided)
3. Update app.py (examples provided)
4. Add .env with credentials
5. Rebuild container → Live data!

## Deployment Path

### Option 1: Quick Demo (Recommended Start)
```bash
# Show the bar owner the beautiful interface with sample data
# Takes 5 minutes to deploy
# Lets them see the "razzle dazzle" immediately
```

### Option 2: Full Production
```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL database
# Hook into your n8n workflow
# Display real, live leaderboard data
# Requires database integration work
```

**Recommendation**: Deploy with sample data first, show the bar owner, get feedback, THEN connect the database. This way they see results fast and you're not blocked on database work.

## How to Deploy (Quick Start)

### 1. Copy Files to Your Server
```bash
# Extract the provided archive
